# multimodel-objectscript-quickstart
This code shows multi-model access in ObjectScript. 

This quickstart can be found in the [Storing and Retrieving Data with InterSystems ObjectScript](https://learning.intersystems.com/course/view.php?name=PracticeObjectScript) exercise. It shows object, relational, and native access from an ObjectScript application, the language built into InterSystems IRIS. Airport data is stored using objects, retrieved using SQL, and a custom data structure is created using globals to handle route information between airports.
