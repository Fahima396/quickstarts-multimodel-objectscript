# multimodel-objectscript-quickstart
This code shows multi-model access in ObjectScript. It is required for the ObjectScript Try It in the Multimodel quickstart.

This quickstart can be found at https://learning.intersystems.com/course/view.php?name=Multimodel It shows object, relational, and native access from an ObjectScript application, the language built into InterSystems IRIS. Airport data is stored using objects, retrieved using SQL, and a custom data structure is created using globals to handle route information between airports.

To use ObjectScript, you can use Studio (available if you've already done a local install) or Atelier (an extension for Eclipse). To set up Atelier, follow the instructions in the following video: [Setting Up Atelier with InterSystems Products](https://learning.intersystems.com/course/view.php?name=Atelier%20InterSystems%20IRIS%20Setup)
